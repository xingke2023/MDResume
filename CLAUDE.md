# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a WeChat Markdown Editor - a highly simplified WeChat Markdown editor that supports Markdown syntax, custom theme styles, content management, multiple image hosting, AI assistant and other features. The editor renders Markdown documents automatically and instantly into WeChat graphics format.

## Architecture Overview

### Core Theme System

The application uses a modular theme system located in `src/config/themes/`:

- Each theme is a separate TypeScript file (e.g., `default.ts`, `grace.ts`, `simple.ts`, `typora-ayu.ts`, `mweb-clean.ts`)
- Themes define styles for `base`, `block`, and `inline` elements using CSS-in-JS objects
- The theme system supports CSS custom properties (`--md-primary-color`) for consistent theming
- New themes can inherit from `defaultTheme` using `toMerged()` or be built from scratch

### Renderer Architecture

The Markdown rendering is handled by `src/utils/renderer.ts`:

- Uses `marked` library with custom renderer extensions
- Supports syntax highlighting via `highlight.js`
- Integrates Mermaid diagrams, KaTeX math, GFM alerts, and footnotes
- The `buildTheme()` function merges base styles with theme-specific overrides
- Themes are compiled into inline styles applied to HTML elements

### Store Management

Uses Pinia for state management (`src/stores/index.ts`):

- Main store handles theme selection, editor content, user preferences
- Supports multiple posts/documents with local storage persistence
- CSS editor with multiple scheme tabs for custom styling
- Configuration for fonts, colors, code themes, and layout options

### Component Structure

- `src/components/CodemirrorEditor/` - Main editor interface with CodeMirror integration
- `src/components/ui/` - Reusable UI components built with Radix Vue and Tailwind
- `src/components/ai/` - AI assistant integration for content generation
- Theme-aware components that respond to global theme changes

### Extension Architecture

The project includes browser extensions:

- Chrome extension in `src/extension/` with separate build process
- Uses WebExtensions API for cross-browser compatibility
- Shared components and utilities with main web application

### Build System

- Vite-based build with TypeScript and Vue 3
- UnoCSS for utility-first CSS
- Multiple build targets: web, Chrome extension, Firefox extension
- Environment-specific builds for different deployment platforms

## Key Files for Theme Development

- `src/config/themes/index.ts` - Theme registry and exports
- `src/config/themes/README.md` - Detailed theme development guide
- `src/types/index.ts` - Theme type definitions and interfaces
- `src/utils/renderer.ts` - Theme compilation and rendering logic

## Adding New Themes

1. Create new theme file in `src/config/themes/`
2. Define theme using `Theme` interface with `base`, `block`, and `inline` sections
3. Register theme in `src/config/themes/index.ts` by adding to `themeMap` and `themeOptions`
4. Theme can inherit from `defaultTheme` using `toMerged()` or be standalone
5. Use `--md-primary-color` CSS variable for consistent theming
6. Test theme across different content types (headers, lists, code blocks, etc.)
